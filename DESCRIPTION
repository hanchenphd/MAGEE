Description: Use a 'glmmkin' class object (GMMAT package) from the null model to perform generalized linear mixed model-based single-variant and variant set main effect tests, gene-environment interaction tests, and joint tests for association, as proposed in Wang et al. (2020) <DOI:10.1002/gepi.22351>.
